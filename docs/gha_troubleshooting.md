## 1. Introduction
GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and testing in the osquery repository. However, sometimes the actions may fail due to various reasons. This guide aims to help developers troubleshoot and resolve these failures effectively.

## 2. Common Error Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Build Failure
Description: The build action fails to compile the code.
Possible Causes: Syntax errors, missing dependencies, incompatible configurations.
Possible Solutions: Review error logs, check dependencies, verify configuration.

### Scenario 2: Test Failure
Description: The test action fails to execute the tests.
Possible Causes: Test failures, incorrect test configurations, environment issues.
Possible Solutions: Review error logs, fix failing tests, adjust test configurations.

### Scenario 3: Linter Failure
Description: The linter action fails to pass the code linting checks.
Possible Causes: Code style violations, linter configuration issues.
Possible Solutions: Review error logs, fix code style violations, adjust linter configurations.

## 3. Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Review Error Logs
When a GitHub Actions run fails, the first step is to review the error logs. The error logs provide valuable information about the cause of the failure. Look for error messages, stack traces, or any other relevant information that can help identify the issue.

### Step 2: Check Dependencies
Ensure that all the required dependencies are correctly installed and up to date. Outdated or missing dependencies can cause build or test failures. Update the dependencies as necessary and retry the GitHub Actions run.

### Step 3: Verify Configuration
Check the configuration files used by the GitHub Actions workflows. Ensure that the configurations are correct and match the desired behavior. Incorrect configurations can lead to unexpected failures. Make any necessary adjustments to the configuration files.

### Step 4: Debugging Techniques
If the issue is not apparent from the error logs, consider using debugging techniques to identify the problem. This may involve adding debug statements, inspecting variables, or running specific commands to gather more information. Use the available debugging tools and techniques to narrow down the cause of the failure.

## 4. Solutions to Common Errors

### Solution 1: Updating Dependencies

If the failure is due to outdated dependencies, update them to the latest versions. Check the project's documentation or the dependency's repository for instructions on updating dependencies. After updating, retry the GitHub Actions run.

### Solution 2: Fixing Code Issues
If the failure is caused by code issues, review the error logs and identify the specific code causing the problem. Fix the code issues, run tests locally to ensure they pass, and then retry the GitHub Actions run.

### Solution 3: Adjusting Configuration
If the failure is related to incorrect configuration, review the configuration files used by the GitHub Actions workflows. Make the necessary adjustments to ensure the configurations match the desired behavior. Retry the GitHub Actions run after making the changes.
